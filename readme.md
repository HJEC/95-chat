<h4 align="center">Demonstration of the original MAC-OS 7 using <a href="http://jamesfriend.com.au/pce-js/pce-js-apps/">this emulator</a></h4>

'95-Chat is a single-page web application built with React/Redux. The core principle of the project was to create a basic social network with account management and chat functionality, based on the visual aesthetic of the Apple MAC Operating System 7, released in 1991.'

### Insights:

I created this experiment with the singular focus of seeing what kind of product I could generate, given a particular style to emulate. It was a chance to demonstrate my aptitude for attention to details, and create unique functionality. It also gave me a great opportunity to get hands on experience with Facebook's React framework, and the Redux state container. I also had some fantastic opportunities to experiment with other libraries to add more creative user-interactable elements, such as the resizable, draggable windows built inside the page.

# Features:

#### 1. Account Registration: <a name="1"></a>

<br>

<p align="center"><img src="/public/gif/register.gif" width="70%"/></p>

What does any good social-network site need? Valid account registration of course! The users are presented with a choice of registering a new account, or logging in to the site. All HTML input is fully sanitized and uploaded to the <strong>SQL</strong> database, which also checks for invalid/missing input. Duplicate emails will throw an error.
The password provided is passed through <strong>Bcrypt</strong> to generate a hash password, which is then saved to the database.
Once registered, the user session cookies are applied with <strong>Cookie-Session</strong> and the DOM is re-rendered with the home page react component.

#### 2. Log-In <a name="2"></a>

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="/public/gif/login.gif" width="70%"/></p>

If a user has an existing account with '95-chat, they can enter their email and password combination to log in. The password hash in the database (corresponding to the provided email) is cross-checked using <strong>Bcrypt compare</strong>. If incorrect, the user will be prompted with an error message to try again, otherwise the session cookies will be reapplied and the DOM will render the home page component again.

#### 3. Password Reset <a name="3"></a>

<br>

<p align="center"><img src="/public/gif/reset.gif" width="70%"/></p>

Using the power of <strong>React component state</strong>, the reset password component is dynamically rendered based on the progress of the reset procedure. The first layout prompts the user for the email of the account. Once entered, the user's email is stored in the component state, then an <strong>Axios request</strong> is made to the server, triggering a function that:

1. Generates a 6 digit secret via <strong>crypto-random-string</strong>
2. Retrieves the user's info from the database via the provided email.
3. Composes an email string with the user's first name, and the secret code.
4. Using the <strong>Amazon Web Services SDK</strong>, an instance of the aws-sdk "SES" is created.
5. The SES instance "SendEmail" method is called, with an object containing the user's email and string containing the reset code as an argument. The email is sent from a provided admin email address.
6. Finally, the secret 6 digit code is then stored in a separate database of password reset codes for later verification.

If this procedure successfully completes, the react state is updated, provoking the DOM to update with the next step of the component.

---

Once the reset email is sent, the user will find in their inbox an email containing the 6 digit reset code. Once the correct code is provided, they will have to provide a new password and submit. Once the submit button is clicked another Axios post request is made to the server. What happens next is:

1. An SQL query is triggered to retrieve the code stored in the database earlier, using the email we put into state during step 1.
2. The code provided by the user is checked against the one retrieved from the database to look for an exact match.
3. If the match succeeds then the new password is now hashed with Bcrypt. The previous password in the database for that user is then updated

Lastly, the state of the component is updated one last time on a successful reset, informing the user that their password has been changed. They can now relocate back to the start to log-in using their new credentials.
